ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm James Lynch, a recent graduate in Software Development with a foundation in Java and JavaScript. Iâ€™m passionate about building clean, efficient code and solving complex problems through innovative software solutions.

Throughout my studies, Iâ€™ve worked on small projects that range from creating guessing game programs and utilizing my expertise in object-oriented programming and modern JavaScript frameworks.

Iâ€™m eager to contribute to open-source projects, collaborate with fellow developers, and continuously expand my skills in full-stack development.

Feel free to check out my projects below and connect with me! ðŸš€
